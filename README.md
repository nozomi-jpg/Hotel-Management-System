# Hotel-Booking-System

The Hotel Booking System is a software application built on the Windows Form utilizing the C# programming language and MSSQL as the database management system. This system is specifically designed to handle the various aspects of hotel operations, with a particular emphasis on the reservation and administration of rooms.

Room Booking: Customers have the ability to view and book rooms of various categories and pricing. Users have the ability to choose specific dates for their bookings, and the system will automatically calculate the total payment by taking into account the room type, price, and duration of stay.

Room Management: Admin can include additional rooms into the system, providing details such as the room category, cost, and a concise overview. In addition, they can modify or remove current room details to maintain an accurate inventory.
